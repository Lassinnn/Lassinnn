### Hello and welcome, my name is Lassi.
#### Welcome to my humble portfolio

I do content on Design and Development. I really enjoy learning new languages and new methods of making my end-products better. My biggest interests are in front-end development with React and UX-design. I enjoy creating wireframes and analysing user data to hone my products.
